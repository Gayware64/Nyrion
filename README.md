# Nyrion
Nyrion is an text based command line. used for simple tasks. Like creating an simple folder or making documents. 
Nyrion is capable of a few basic commands. In the future it will gain the capabilty to run from it very own commands and it will not rely on the commands of Windows anymore. Also I plan making this an full blown operating system.

Nyrion 1.1 has
- A loading screen
- Capabilty to take over simple CMD commands.
- Its own prefix (Lion v0.1.1)
- An calculator
- Abilty to check system specs and IP adress

- PLANNED
- Being able to install apps 
- Being able to use the internet
